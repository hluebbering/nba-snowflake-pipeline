# üèÄ NBA Player Performance Pipeline with Snowflake

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a scalable ELT pipeline using Snowflake and Python for NBA player performance analysis. Data is sourced from the NBA API and stored in Snowflake for advanced querying and fan engagement insights.
- Create an end-to-end **data science workflow** within Snowflake to store, transform, and model NBA player performance data, specifically predicting **points per game** using machine learning directly integrated with Snowflake‚Äôs cloud environment.


## Features
- Ingest NBA player stats, team rosters, and game logs via `nba_api`
- Load raw + transformed data into Snowflake
- Dimensional modeling: `dim_players`, `dim_teams`, `fact_player_game_stats`
- Analytical queries: top performers, usage rate, trends over time
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, nba_api, Snowflake (with `snowflake-connector-python`), SQL (for data modeling)


----------------------------------


### **Step 1: Data Ingestion & Storage (Python + Snowflake)**
- Use `nba_api` to pull player game log data.
- Load raw data directly into **Snowflake staging tables** using Python‚Äôs `snowflake-connector-python`.


### **Step 2: Data Transformation (SQL/dbt in Snowflake)**
- Within Snowflake, create clean dimensional tables (players, games, teams).
- Build aggregated feature tables:
  - Recent game averages
  - Player performance metrics (efficiency rating, usage rate, etc.)
  - Team-level defensive/offensive metrics.


### **Step 3: Feature Engineering in Snowflake**
- Write `SQL` queries within Snowflake to generate predictive features:
  - Player rolling averages (5-game, 10-game)
  - Team defense metrics
  - Rest days between games
  - Home/Away impact

### **Step 4: ML Modeling (Snowpark + Python)**
- Use **Snowpark** (Snowflake‚Äôs native Python framework) to train ML models directly on data stored in Snowflake.
- Recommended model: XGBoost or Random Forest for regression (predicting points per game).

### **Step 5: Deploy Model Predictions in Snowflake**
- Store prediction outputs back in Snowflake tables.
- Use these predictions for automated reporting, dashboards, or real-time analytics.
